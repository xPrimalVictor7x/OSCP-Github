1) Open CherryTree template to take screenshots and paste outputs.
2) Run simple nmap and then the slower.
3) Check first results (webs, ssh, ftp) from the first fast nmap scan.
4) Review slower nmap scan.
    - Always go for the easiest port (SMB, FTP, HTTP...).
    - Depend on each port do the appropiate enumeration techniches.
4) Use most of your time to find exploits and try them.
    - In case webpage is your target, look the source code, ever, will find software versions, for example.
5) When you get the exploit and you have tweaked it for your target and purpose you should be inside as low user.
6) Simple enumeration such as OS version, users, permissions, files in home, compilers, available tools.
    - In case of Windows, with systeminfo is enough for me https://github.com/GDSSecurity/Windows-Exploit-Suggester
7) Find out how to upload files.
8) Upload your privilege escalation script.
    - In case of Linux I always used LinEnum and linux-exploit-suggester
    - Check services running and check the strange ones in gtfobins or lolbas and exploit-db
9) Run your exploit and get root, collect proofs, passwords, review root paths and home paths for interesting files for other machines.
